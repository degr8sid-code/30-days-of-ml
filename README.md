# 30 Days of Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Thank you for visting this repository. This repository consits of basic, initial skills required to be a data scientist. I hope the content shared in this repository will be meaningful to you.

Initially, the plan was to start from 1st December, but life happened, and I'm 5 days behind my schedule. Hopefully, we'll be able to cover main, crucial topics by 31st December, 2023.

## Introduction

I was inspired by the idea of [RaviTeja](https://github.com/ds-teja), who is working on the 100 Days challenge. However, since I have a background in CS, and I'm already familiar with Python and quite a few ML concepts, I'm pushing myself by creating a 30-day meaningful challenge.

So, what are you waiting for? Let's get started! Don't forget to STAR this repo to get updates!
